#What is this?
This is a chrome extension which saves a lot of time in your life.

#Main functionality
Choosing some movies which is more than 95% quality and show the longest movie of them.

#Why is this extension useful?
Though the time that you choose movies has been short in only once, if you have used xvideos many times, you perhaps seem that a lot of time is in vain. This extension choose movies automatically instead of you (so you need not to do that!) and helps you to live an efficient life! 

#How to use
* install(easy)
 - You can download this extension by zip.
 - From "chrome://extensions/", you can install this extension.
* After installing, go to pages you want in xvideos.com and automatically, it runs.
 - For example, main page, some tags. (pages which is some contents showed) 
 - In details, http://jp.xvideos.com/, http://jp.xvideos.com/hits/, http://www.xvideos.com/best/day/, http://jp.xvideos.com/c/Amateur-17, and so on.

##Attention
If there are no movies which have more than 95% quality, this extension cannot choose and show movies.

#In future
I plan to add some functionality.
* Change to browserAction..
* Choose different movies by clicking browserAction button.
* Can use options. (choose quality, and so on.)
